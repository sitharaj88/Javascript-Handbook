## Overview

JavaScript is a versatile programming language that powers modern web applications. Before diving into advanced concepts, understanding the **basics** is crucial. This section will provide a strong foundation in JavaScript fundamentals.

Each topic has its **own dedicated file** for in-depth exploration:

### 1. [Syntax and Structure](1-syntax-and-structure.md)
Learn about JavaScript syntax, statements, expressions, comments, indentation, and best practices for writing clean and maintainable code.

### 2. [Variables and Scoping](2-variables-and-scoping.md)
Explore different variable declarations (`let`, `const`, `var`), scope types (global, function, block), hoisting behavior, and the Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ).

### 3. [Data Types Deep Dive](3-data-types-deep-dive.md)
Understand JavaScript's primitive data types (`string`, `number`, `boolean`, `null`, `undefined`, `symbol`, `bigint`), and reference types (`object`, `array`, `function`). Learn how they behave in memory.

### 4. [Type Coercion](4-type-coercion.md)
Unravel how JavaScript automatically converts data types, the difference between `==` and `===`, truthy and falsy values, and common pitfalls of implicit conversions.

### 5. [Functions](5-functions.md)
Delve into function declarations vs. expressions, arrow functions, Immediately Invoked Function Expressions (IIFE), higher-order functions, and function best practices.
