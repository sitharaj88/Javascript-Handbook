# Testing Frameworks (Jest, Playwright)

**Testing** is a crucial part of modern JavaScript development, ensuring code reliability, maintainability, and bug-free releases. This guide explores two widely-used testing tools: **Jest** for unit and integration testing and **Playwright** for end-to-end (E2E) testing.

## 🌟 1. Introduction to Testing

Testing verifies that code performs as expected. It catches errors early, ensures functionality, and allows for safer code refactoring.

### 🔥 **Types of Testing:**
- **Unit Testing:** Tests individual functions or components.
- **Integration Testing:** Tests interactions between modules.
- **End-to-End (E2E) Testing:** Tests the entire application flow from user perspective.

---

## ⚡ 2. Why Testing Matters

- **Prevents regressions** by verifying new code doesn’t break existing functionality.
- **Improves code quality** by encouraging modular and well-structured code.
- **Speeds up development** with fewer manual checks.
- **Increases confidence** when deploying new features.

---

## 🏃 3. Jest: Unit and Integration Testing

### ✨ **Key Features of Jest:**
- **Zero Config:** Works out of the box for most JavaScript projects.
- **Snapshot Testing:** Ensures UI consistency.
- **Mocking:** Built-in mocking for functions and modules.
- **Parallel Testing:** Runs tests concurrently for speed.

### ⚙️ **Setting Up Jest:**
```bash
npm install --save-dev jest
```

**package.json:**
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "test": "jest"
  }
}
```

### 💡 **Writing Tests with Jest:**
```js
// sum.js
export const sum = (a, b) => a + b;

// sum.test.js
test('adds 1 + 2 to equal 3', () => {
  expect(sum(1, 2)).toBe(3);
});
```

### 🏗️ **When to Use Jest:**
- Testing individual functions and components.
- Snapshot testing for UI components.
- Integration testing for module interactions.

---

## 🧪 4. Playwright: End-to-End Testing

### ✨ **Key Features of Playwright:**
- **Cross-Browser Testing:** Supports Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit.
- **Headless Mode:** Runs tests without opening the browser.
- **Powerful Selectors:** Supports text, CSS, XPath selectors.
- **Parallel Execution:** Runs tests concurrently.

### ⚙️ **Setting Up Playwright:**
```bash
npm install -D @playwright/test
npx playwright install
```

### 💡 **Writing E2E Tests with Playwright:**
```js
// example.spec.js
const { test, expect } = require('@playwright/test');

test('homepage has title and links to docs', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto('https://playwright.dev/');
  await expect(page).toHaveTitle(/Playwright/);
  await page.click('text=Docs');
  await expect(page).toHaveURL(/.*docs/);
});
```

### 🏗️ **When to Use Playwright:**
- Testing user flows across different browsers.
- Automating UI interactions.
- Running headless tests in CI/CD pipelines.

## ⚖️ 5. Comparing Jest and Playwright

| Feature              | **Jest**               | **Playwright**           |
|----------------------|------------------------|--------------------------|
| **Primary Use**      | Unit & integration     | End-to-end (E2E)         |
| **Test Speed**       | Fast (in-memory)       | Slower (browser-based)   |
| **Configuration**    | Minimal (zero-config)  | Requires browser setup   |
| **Snapshot Testing** | Supported              | Not supported            |
| **Cross-Browser**    | No                     | Yes                      |

## 💡 6. Best Practices for Testing

- ✅ **Write clear, descriptive test cases.**
- ✅ **Test one thing per test** for simplicity and clarity.
- ✅ **Use mocks and spies** to isolate functionality.
- ✅ **Run tests in CI/CD pipelines** for continuous verification.
- ✅ **Keep tests fast** by limiting E2E tests to critical paths.

---

## ⚠️ 7. Common Pitfalls

- ❌ **Over-testing UI components** with E2E tests instead of unit tests.
- ❌ **Not cleaning up after tests**, causing flaky results.
- ❌ **Relying solely on manual testing**, which is error-prone.
- ❌ **Ignoring test performance**, leading to slow builds.

## 📌 8. Summary

| Aspect                 | **Jest**                 | **Playwright**             |
|------------------------|--------------------------|----------------------------|
| **Testing Type**       | Unit, Integration        | End-to-End (E2E)           |
| **Best For**           | Functions, components    | Full app workflows         |
| **Setup Complexity**   | Minimal                  | Moderate                   |
| **Execution Speed**    | Fast                     | Slower (browser-based)     |
| **Cross-Browser Support** | No                   | Yes                        |
