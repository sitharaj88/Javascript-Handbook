## 🏗️ 1. Module Bundlers (Vite, Rollup)

**Module bundlers** compile JavaScript files and their dependencies into optimized bundles for deployment, improving performance and scalability.

### ⚡ **Key Concepts:**
- **Vite:** Offers lightning-fast builds with native ES modules and hot module replacement (HMR).
- **Rollup:** Ideal for libraries with its superior tree-shaking capabilities and smaller bundles.

### ✨ **Topics Covered:**
- How Vite accelerates development.
- Optimizing libraries with Rollup.
- Real-world configuration examples.

## 🧪 2. Testing Frameworks (Jest, Playwright)

**Testing** ensures applications run as expected, preventing future regressions and enhancing reliability.

### 🔍 **Key Testing Tools:**
- **Jest:** Powerful for unit and integration testing with snapshot capabilities.
- **Playwright:** End-to-end testing with cross-browser automation support.

### ✨ **Topics Covered:**
- Writing robust unit tests with Jest.
- Automating browser tests with Playwright.
- Integrating tests into CI/CD pipelines.

## 🐞 3. Debugging Tools (Chrome DevTools, Sourcemaps)

**Debugging** is essential for identifying and resolving issues efficiently during development and production.

### 🛠️ **Key Debugging Tools:**
- **Chrome DevTools:** Provides features like breakpoints, performance profiling, and network analysis.
- **Sourcemaps:** Map minified code back to the original source for easier debugging.

### ✨ **Topics Covered:**
- Leveraging Chrome DevTools for in-depth debugging.
- Generating and using sourcemaps for smoother troubleshooting.
- Debugging best practices for JavaScript applications.
