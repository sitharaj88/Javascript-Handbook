## 🌟 1. Rendering Optimization (Reflow vs. Repaint)

Learn how the browser renders pages and how to optimize rendering performance by minimizing costly operations.

### 🔥 **Key Concepts:**
- **Reflow:** Recalculating element positions and geometries.
- **Repaint:** Redrawing visual parts of the page.
- **Performance Techniques:** Minimize reflows and repaints, use efficient CSS, and batch DOM changes.

## 📦 2. Bundle Optimization (Tree-Shaking, Code-Splitting)

Understand how to reduce application bundle size for faster load times and better performance.

### ⚡ **Key Techniques:**
- **Tree-Shaking:** Remove unused code during the build process.
- **Code-Splitting:** Load code only when needed using dynamic imports.
- **Minification & Compression:** Reduce file size with tools like Terser and Gzip.

## 🏃‍♂️ 3. Web Workers (Offscreen Canvas)

Offload heavy computations and rendering tasks to background threads using Web Workers and OffscreenCanvas.

### ✨ **Topics Covered:**
- **Web Workers:** Run scripts in the background, separate from the main thread.
- **OffscreenCanvas:** Render graphics off the main UI thread for smoother animations.
- **Performance Benefits:** Prevent UI freezes and improve rendering performance.
