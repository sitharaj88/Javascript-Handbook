## Overview

Mastering these advanced concepts will give you deeper insights into how JavaScript works under the hood, enabling you to write more efficient and optimized code. Each topic is presented in a **dedicated file** for detailed exploration.

### 1. [Closures and Lexical Scope](1-closures-and-lexical-scope.md)
- Understand how functions access variables from outer scopes.
- Explore practical use cases like data encapsulation and memoization.
- Learn best practices and avoid common pitfalls.

### 2. [Prototypes and Inheritance](2-prototypes-and-inheritance.md)
- Learn how JavaScript uses prototypal inheritance.
- Understand prototype chains and how objects share properties and methods.
- Explore ES6 class-based inheritance with real-world examples.

### 3. [The `this` Keyword (Dynamic vs. Lexical Context)](3-this-keyword.md)
- Grasp how `this` behaves in different contexts (global, object, function, and arrow functions).
- Learn how `call()`, `apply()`, and `bind()` influence `this`.
- Understand dynamic and lexical scoping of `this`.

### 4. [Promises and Async/Await (Microtask Queue)](4-promises-async-await.md)
- Deep dive into asynchronous programming in JavaScript.
- Understand how the event loop and microtask queue manage asynchronous tasks.
- Learn best practices for handling asynchronous operations using Promises and `async/await`.

### 5. [Iterators and Generators](5-iterators-generators.md)
- Explore how iterators work and how they enable `for...of` loops.
- Learn how generators can simplify complex asynchronous code using `yield`.
- Understand real-world use cases for iterators and generators.

### 6. [Memory Management (GC, Memory Leaks)](6-memory-management.md)
- Learn how JavaScript's garbage collector works.
- Identify common causes of memory leaks and strategies to avoid them.
- Understand memory lifecycle and performance optimization techniques.
