## Overview

JavaScript is the **language of the web**, powering dynamic functionality in browsers, servers, and beyond. This handbook is organized into multiple sections, each focusing on different aspects of the language and its ecosystem. You’ll learn about **basic syntax**, **advanced concepts**, **browser APIs**, **performance optimization**, **security**, and so much more.

> **Goal**: Provide a **comprehensive** and **practical** reference, from **fundamentals** to **cutting-edge** features, complete with **examples**, **exercises**, and **real-world projects**.
